POMOD(1)                         X Notes                        POMOD(1)

NAME
       pomod - pomodoro daemon

SYNOPSIS
       pomod [-S socket] [-l time] [-p time] [-s time]
       pomo [-S socket] [start|stop|info]

DESCRIPTION
       pomod is a timer daemon that implements the pomodoro technique.
       The pomod command is the server; it times pomodoro and break
       cycles while waiting for commands from the client.  The pomo
       command is the client; it send commands to the server for
       controling the timer.

       When called, the pomod command begins with the timer stopped and
       waits for the client to start it.  Once started, it begins a
       pomodoro.  After a pomodoro, a break begins.  After each four
       pomodoros, the break is a long break, otherwise it is a short
       break.  By default, a pomodoro lasts 25 minutes; a short break
       lasts 5 minutes and a long break lasts 30 minutes.  When the
       cycle changes (from a pomodoro to a short break, for example),
       the name of the new step is printed to stdout.

       The pomo command has three subcommands, which control the server
       or get information from it.  The following subcommands are known:

       start  Begins a new pomodoro.

       stop   Stop the timer.

       info   Get the current cycle from the server and print the timer
              in minutes and seconds.

       The options for both commands are as follows:

       -S socket
              The path to the socket.  By default the socket is
              /tmp/pomodoro.UID

       The options for pomod are as follows:

       -l time
              Time in minutes for the long break.

       -p time
              Time in minutes for the pomodoro.

       -s time
              Time in minutes for the short break.
